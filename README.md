# MineClone2.0, the April Fool's version

This modpack aims to add "features" (read: chaos) added in [Minecraft 2.0](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Java_Edition_2.0).

Features done:

* The [Etho Slab](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Etho_Slab): slab variant of [TNT](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/TNT), but spawns anvil above entities around the explosion.
* Modified [Block of Coal](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Block_of_Coal): Using modified texture of [Block of Redstone](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Block_of_Redstone), [Coal](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Coal) crafted from this block cannot be stacked with other coals.
* Explosive [Furnaces](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Furnace): If furnaces are run for a very long time, it may overheat and eventually explode.

Features that are actually part of existing gameplay:

* Tinted [Glass](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Glass): Glass with colors. Already added in [Minecraft 1.7.2](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Java_Edition_1.7.2) under the name Stained Glass. Don't be confused with the [Tinted Glass](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Tinted_glass) added in [Minecraft 1.17](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Java_Edition_1.17).

Features not yet implemented:

* [Burunt-out Torches](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Torch_(Burnt-out)): Torches will burn out after a random period of time. Use [Flint and Steel](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Flint_and_steel) to relit them. Use [Lanterns](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Lantern) if you don't want to be annoyed.
* Pig Horses and Cow Horses: Retextured pigs and cows obtainable via spawn eggs.
* Pink Wither: A "hostile" (read: friendly) boss that restores health to mobs and apply bone meal to surrounding blocks.
* [Diamond Chickens](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Diamond_Chicken): Rarely spawns instead of a normal chicken, lays [diamonds](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Diamond) or [lapis lazuli](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Lapis_lazuli), or explodes instead of laying eggs.
* [Floppers](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Dropper): Renamed droppers that always drops [raw fish](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Raw_Cod).
* Fat animals: Pigs, Mooshrooms, Cows, Sheep, and Chickens will become so fat after 10 feds that they explode.
* Flying [Sheeps](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Sheep): Using a [golden apple](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Golden_apple) makes them fly.
* "Battle signs" of [Zombie Pigmen](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Zombie_Pigmen): Zombified Piglin now carry "battle signs".
* "Super Hostile Mode": Very awful situations where players are striked by nightning bolts and attacked by strong mobs.
* Speech bubbles: blocks and mobs may give reactions through speech bubbles.

Features waiting for MineClone 2 or Minetest Engine features:

* [Redstone Bug](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Redstone_Bug): Retextured [silverfish](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Silverfish), spawns when Redstone strength increases. Since the Redstone system in MineClone 2 is not yet well-implemented, it is impossible to this feature to function properly.
* Super HD Graphics: Makes all textures monochrome. It is currently impossible to change block textures on-the-fly, and creating a copy of all textures is impractical and would be not compatible with non-MineClone mods.
